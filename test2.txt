The things I love about technology are many and varied. 
I love the possibilities technology provides both now and for the future. 
The ability to simply record things and play them back is valuable beyond reason. 
Images, video, music,can all be accessible without having to be present for the original performance. 
Communication and transportation would still have unbelievable limitations without technology.  

I also love the ability of technology to automate and speed up almost anything as well as check for and prevent errors from ever happening.  
Imagine our first space flights or rocket launches using a simple pocket calculator to compute the trajectory instead of a slide rule and log tables! 

These are just two of the things I love about technology.  I could keep this up all day.
